# RELEASE - Location of external products
#
# NOTE: The build does not check dependancies on files
# external to this application. Thus you should run
# "gnumake clean uninstall install" in the top directory
# each time EPICS_BASE, SNCSEQ, or any other external
# module defined in a RELEASE* file is rebuilt.
#
# Host/target specific settings can be specified in files named
#   RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#   RELEASE.Common.$(T_A)
#   RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)

# If needed, set INSTALL_LOCATION in CONFIG_SITE

# Location of preceeding modules

EPICS_BASE = /usr/local/epics/extensions-base/3.14.12.3-ext1
